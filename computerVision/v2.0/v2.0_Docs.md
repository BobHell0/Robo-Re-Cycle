# Version 2.0 Model
The previous model (v1.0), seems to require a sufficient lighting for adaquete screw detection. The goal of this model was to try reduce the necessity of additional lighting. The Roland's interior environment only contains dim blue lights so if this model is successful in meeting the goal, with further improvements, we may not need any additional lighting. 

The other major change that you would see in the v2.0 dataset is the angle and distance between the hard drive and the phone camera has been drastically changed. Since it had been proposed that the camera could be placed on the ceiling of the Roland instead of the wall, the images in this data set were taken **parallel to the hard drive** and **50 cm away**.
