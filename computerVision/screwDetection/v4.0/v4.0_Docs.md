# Version 4.0 Model
In an attempt to improve the dataset from version 3.0 (images purely taken at the Roland), a superset of images was produced. That is, the same images used to train 3.0 were combined with additional images taken away from the Roland (although still using the Pi camera). These images were taken **50 cm away and parallel to the HDD**, just like in v2.0. The primary difference was the use of the Raspberry Pi camera instead of a smartphone's camera. Like before, 300 epochs were used to train the model. The resulting model was an improvement from v3.0, since *some* screws could *occasionally* be detected. However, high occurences of complete misses and inaccuracies meant this model was likely to be completely unviable.
