# Version 6.0 Model
Since Jack and Dharma created the wooden bed for the Roland, the previous model was not particuarly effective in detecting screws. 

Therefore, I obtained a new dataset of images of the hard drive on this wooden bed. Something to note is that the camera consistently struggled to focus on the hard drive to produce a sharp image. Rather, the screws appeared blurred. Despite this, after training a fresh model over 300 epochs, the results were promising and accurate.
