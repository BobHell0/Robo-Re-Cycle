# Version 1.0 Model
Based on the dimensions of the Roland milling machine, the dimensions of the bed and the distance from the bed to the side walls of the milling machine, I determined that one potential position for a camera would be 340 mm away from the nearest edge of the hard drive, and with an angle of elevation of 45ยบ. Based on these numbers, I trained v1.0 of the computer vision model for Robo-Re-Cycle. All annotated training data (found in computerVision_v1.0_annotatedDataset.zip) consists of images where the camera was positioned 340 mm away from the closest edge, and raised to an angle of 45ยบ.

The lighting of the images were varied by turning the room light on and off and also using a bedside lamp, shining it at different positions on the hard drive and at different random angles.
