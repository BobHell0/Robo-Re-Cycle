# Version 3.0 Model
This model purely used data taken from the Roland and the Raspberry Pi camera. The purpose of this was primarily to collect data that would emulate the images that the vision model would be provided when the final machine is working. Not many images were taken on this day (< 50) so 300 epochs were run. However, the lack of data need result in a poor model. This model will not be considered in contention for the vision system.
